### Script Overview

This Python script serves multiple purposes in a penetration testing scenario, including maintaining a persistent connection and exfiltrating data. Each section of the script is designed to ensure reliable data transfer and keep the connection active during the file transmission process.

### Key Functions

- **create_connection()**:  
  This function is critical as it establishes the initial TCP connection to the target machine. Without this connection, the script cannot communicate or transfer any data to the target.

- **send_heartbeat()**:  
  Heartbeat messages are vital for preventing the connection from being dropped by idle timeouts. This function ensures the connection stays active by sending periodic "HEARTBEAT" signals to the target, making the transfer more resilient to network interruptions.

- **send_file()**:  
  File transfer is the core functionality of the script. This function reads the specified file in chunks and sends it over the established connection. By sending data in small 1024-byte packets, it helps prevent network congestion and ensures that large files can be sent without overloading the buffer.

- **main()**:  
  The main function serves as the controller of the script, starting the connection process, triggering the heartbeat mechanism, and initiating the file transfer. It ensures that the script’s components work together in the correct order, maintaining the connection while sending the data.

### Execution Flow

1. **Establishes a connection to the target**:  
   Without this step, the script would not have a way to communicate with the target machine. Establishing the connection is the first and most important task.

2. **Starts a heartbeat thread**:  
   By maintaining the connection with periodic heartbeat signals, this step ensures that the TCP connection remains open and uninterrupted. It adds resilience to the script, preventing unexpected disconnections during the data transfer.

3. **Sends the specified file**:  
   This is the central action of the script. Sending the file allows the attacker or tester to exfiltrate data from the target machine. Without this step, the script would not fulfill its intended purpose.

4. **Keeps the connection open until interrupted**:  
   Keeping the connection open allows the transfer process to run uninterrupted until it’s manually stopped. It ensures the script doesn’t prematurely close, allowing the entire file to be sent successfully.

By combining these sections, the script achieves its goal of transferring files while keeping the connection alive, even in challenging network conditions.
